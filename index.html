      <h1>Letter from our Cabinet</h1>
      <p>
        Greetings! <br><br> On behalf of our THISMUN Executive Team and 
        Advisors Dr. Benita Sumita and Ms. Katie Sykes, we cordially 
        invite you to our fifth annual conference, THISMUN V March 2025.
      </p>
      <p>
        In our ever-changing world, conflict induced displacement is at an 
        all-time high. The rates of forcibly displaced people have risen 
        astonishingly, illustrating that people have involuntary gave up what 
        they deserve, whether it be quality education, a healthy sanctuary, or
         simply just a home. In just the last five years, the number of refugees
          has experienced a fifty-percent increase to north of thirty million. 
          Parties in the international community are facing growing challenges 
          in fulfilling their promises to a united nation, sanctuary for all, 
          and equal academic opportunities, due to escalating economic, social,
           and cultural conflicts.
      </p>
      <p>
        As these issues persist, those left hanging in the balance by those broken 
        promises continue to struggle with the opportunity for reconciliation dwindling.
         Hence, the international community needs to revisit those broken promises
        that have devasted many. With countries departing from the promise and norms 
        of global cooperation to moving closer towards self-interest, it is no
         surprise that those in the balances have been forgotten.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finding ingenious solutions for issues of displacement and its discontents 
        is therefore the goal of this year’s THISMUN conference. The committees -- 
        EU, UN Women, and UNSC – aim to galvanize delegates into revisiting broken 
        promises in topics of the refugee crisis, quality of education, and matters 
        of warfare. In so doing, we hope to embody the United Nation’s original purpose 
        by reactivating “international co-operation in solving international 
        problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character”.
      </p>
      <p class="regards">
        THISMUN Executive Board,
      </p>
