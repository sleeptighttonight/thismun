      <h1>Letter from our Cabinet:</h1>
      <p>
        Greetings! <br><br> On behalf of the THISMUN Executive Team and 
        Advisor Dr. Benita Sumita, we cordially 
        invite you to our fifth annual conference, THISMUN VI March 2026, hosted in collaboration with
        the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) affiliated Global SDGs and Leadership Development Center.
      </p>
      <p>
        Established in November 2024 through a partnership between UNITAR and the Global Youth
Leadership Development Council (GYLDC), the UNITAR affiliated Global SDGs and Leadership
Development Center was created to address complex regional challenges like climate change,
inequality, and resource depletion by empowering future leaders. The Center’s mission is to
advance the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the Asia-Pacific region through core
activities including leadership development programs, climate change and sustainability
workshops, volunteer-driven community projects, and international knowledge-sharing
forums. It also facilitates visits to UN offices to provide firsthand insight into global
governance, aiming to cultivate a generation with the skills and global perspective needed to
drive sustainable development forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is precisely this kind of cooperation that is needed to counter humanity's enduring tendency
toward division. Of the two, the moments of division are often the most provocative – the
most effort from Earth’s international community consisting of 17,400 ethnic groups across
195 countries. According to Crisis Group’s fatality tally, more than seven thousand people have
already been killed in Turkey and Northern Iraq since 2015 throughout the Kurdish Conflict.
World War II had a devasting number of more than seventy million deaths. More than 1.91
million children in conflict zones in Africa are forced out of an education they deserve. These
staggering figures, all rooting from a divisive society, reflect the divisive world where live in. A world where conflict and discord continue to claim lives, disrupt education, and fracture
communities. Hence, it’s time for the international community to renew its commitment to
solving critical issues that are most detrimental to citizens across the globe. But as economic,
social, and cultural conflicts escalate worldwide, the international community is increasingly
struggling to deliver on its promises of security, equity, and unity for all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finding responses and rethinking how we approach the issues fracturing our world is
therefore the goal of this year’s THISMUN conference. Despite being set in different
timeframes and locations, the committees – UN Security Council, UN General Assembly,
UNFCC, UN Women, and the Historical Committee – all aim to empower delegates to rethink
ways to bridge our increasingly divided world through unpacking the Kurdish conflict, delving
into the quality of women’s education in conflict zones, building an ethical AI framework, and
reexamining the Treaty of Versailles. In doing so, we hope to embody and promote the United
Nation’s original premise by practicing “international co-operation in solving international
problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character” in our own lives. At THIS,
we promote true leadership, through action, inspiration, and purposeful progress. Whether
it’s within our school ground, or across larger communities, we encourage students to lead
with purpose, empathy, and integrity. Please join our efforts and save the first weekend of
March 2026 for an engaging conference.
      </p>
      <p class="regards">
        THISMUN Executive Board
